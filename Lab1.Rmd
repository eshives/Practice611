#Linear Regression

##Assumptions

Standard analysis of linear regression is based on the following *four assumptions*:

1. Linear relation with fixed regressions

1. Independence

1. Constant variance

1. Mean zero error

These assumptions can be succinctly written as $Y_i = X_i^T\beta + \epsilon_i$, $epsilon_i\sim^{iid} D(0, \sigma^2)$

(Hint - LaTex scripts: \$Y_i = X_i^T \beta + \epsilon_i\$, \$\epsilon_i \sim^{iid} D(0, \sigma^2)\$)

#Example
Using `mtcars` dataset, we fit a linear regression in `R`.

```{r}
out = lm(mpg ~ disp +wt, data = mtcars)
```


```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(out)$coef, digits=2, caption="Regression table")
```


The variable `wt` has statistically significant association with `mpg`.

Next, we present the residual plot.  

(Hint: plot(lm.object, which = 1))

```{r,fig.cap="residual plot",echo=FALSE}
plot(out,1)
```
